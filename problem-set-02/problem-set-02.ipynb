    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll implement the Huffman Coding algorithm (Algorithm 2 on the problem set).\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent bit strings (code words) as lists of boolean values, where `True` represents a \"one\"-bit and `False` represents a \"zero\" bit.\n",
    "Please be aware that this would be an extremely inefficient representation for a real application, but the simplicity of this representation will make it easier to understand the algorithm."

    "### Proposed Representation of the Huffman Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a proposal for how you could represent the Huffman tree.\n",
    "Feel free to use your own representation if you have a better idea.\n",
    "This proposal is optimized for *encoding* because it stores only pointers from nodes to their parents.\n",
    "If you want to use the Huffman tree for efficient *decoding* then you should also store the inverse pointers from nodes to their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Huffman tree represents a code book as a binary tree with the symbols $x \\in \\mathfrak X = \\{0,1,\\ldots, |\\mathfrak X|-1\\}$ at its leaves.\n",
    "Any binary tree with $|\\mathfrak X|$ leaves has a total of $(2|\\mathfrak X| - 1)$ nodes (including the leaves), regardless of the specific shape of the tree.\n",
    "We represent the tree as a list (named `parent_nodes`) of length $(2|\\mathfrak X| - 1)$ with the following properties:\n",
    "- the first $|\\mathfrak X|$ entries of the list `parent_nodes` correspond to the leaf nodes, i.e., the symbols $x\\in\\{0,1,\\ldots,|\\mathfrak X|-1\\}$;\n",
    "- the remaining $(|\\mathfrak X|-1)$ entries of the list `parent_nodes` correspond to non-leaf nodes, with the root node at the very end;\n",
    "- each entry of the list `parent_nodes` is a tuple `(index, label)` where `index` is an index into `parent_nodes` pointing at the parent of the current node, and `label` is the label of the edge between the node and its parent (which is either `True` or `False`);\n",
    "- since the root node has no parent, `parent_nodes[len(parent_nodes) - 1]` will always be `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read and understand the code in the method `encode_symbol`.\n",
    "  Then complete the constructor (`__init__`) so that it creates the tree structure that `encode_symbol` expects.\n",
    "- Run the minimal provided unit test to make sure you didn't do any obvious mistake.\n",
    "- Implement and run additional unit tests. In particular, test edge case like ties or a degenerate probability distribution (that puts all mass on a single symbol."
